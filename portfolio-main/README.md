# Darvish — Portfolio

A terminal-inspired personal portfolio built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my projects, tech stack, and contact information through a clean glass UI with typing animations and a command-mode interface. Designed to be minimal, responsive, and interactive, the site reflects how I enjoy building practical, hands-on solutions with code.
